# LendingClub
UpGrad's Lending Club case study 

It was asked to analyse and observe loan dataset to filter applicants who can default 
Knowing this is highly beneficial for any loan lending firm to decrease it's liabilities.

I've tried to few steps to do so start from reading and understanding dataset and then cleaning and visualising it.

I've also used dtale lib as it is highly objective rich with extensive functionalities for dataframes
